<h1>goodViberations: Functionality Specification</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    This app is a data entry app, the implementation of the app uses activities (forms in conventional terms) to perform
    the common CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations seen in most data centric computer software.
</p>
<p>
    The UI, described in <a href="UIActivities.html">UIActivities.html</a>, is used to render the data to
    the end user. The UI facilitates the user's interaction  (CRUD) with the data. The actual work of creating new data,
    retrieving data, updating data, deleting data, and ensuring data integrity is specified in this document.
</p>
<p>
    The data structures used in this app are described in <a href="DataLayer.html">DataLayer.html</a>
</p>
<p>
    In order to successfully encapsulate the functionality required to define the data and to
    implement the CRUD operations on the data, this document describes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The binding of the data structures to the UI</li>
    <li>The functionality of the app, including the navigation between activities</li>
</ul>
