<h1>goodViberations blog</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    This file is maintained as the project progresses. Initially this paragraph is
    the first and last paragraph, as time and new pieces are added, this paragraph will still be the
    last one, but no longer the first. This is how a blog works, I think.
</p>
<h1>15 Dec 2025: git tag v2.0</h1>
<p>
    I am now working on <strong>tag v2.0</strong>, adding the ui specification (<a href="UIActivities.html">UIActivities.html</a>),
    and a start for the functionality specification (<a href="Functionality.html">Functionality.html</a>).
    It is expected that the specs will be updated over the course of this project. Each addition to this blog
    should be accompanied by a git tag, in this way it is possible to get a snapshot of the project that
    matches the blog entry.
</p>
<p>
    All the screens (activities) of the app are now described in <a href="UIActivities.html">UIActivities.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The data layer has been moved to <a href="DataLayer.html">DataLayer.html</a>, a brief description of the
    data structure (list of entries) has been started on.
</p>
<p>
    The functionality has not really been started on, it has a placeholder as described in <a href="Functionality.html">Functionality.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
    At this point it is possible to run the agent on the specification files. The expected output is
    a set of class files for the UI and data layer. Once generated these can be reviewed to see what
    Gemini has created. This gives me the opportunity to get acquainted with using the IDE to preview
    UI classes, and to learn a bit of Kotlin, from a consumer's viewpoint.
</p>
<p>
    The following prompt is given, it was suggested by the IDE's smart code suggestion:<br/><br/>
    <cite style="padding-left: 1em;">can you generate the code for the ui specification</cite>
</p>
<p>
    <table style="width:100%">
    <tr>
        <td>
            <img src="img/v2_0_ui_spec_generated_code.png" alt="v2_0_ui_spec_generated_code.png"/>
        </td>
        <td style="vertical-align: top">
            Looks like it generated the classes I hoped for, they now need to be reviewed: I hope to be able to
            preview them in the IDE.
        </td>
    </tr>

<h1>In the beginning (git tags v1.0 and v2.0)</h1>
<p>
    I've created a new android app using Android Studio, and pushed it to git with the
    <strong>tag v1.0</strong>
