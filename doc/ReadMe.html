    <h1>ReadMe: goodViberations, built using  AI Agent(s)</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        goodViberations is a password manager app.<br/><br/>
        The project sources can be found on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/jplatipus/goodViberations">
        https://github.com/jplatipus/goodViberations</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a README file for the goodViberations project. It uses HTML and not markup, txt, or any
        other format. HTML is nice, doesn't need any special software to view the contents either in raw or
        rendered form.
        <br><br/>
        HTML allows screenshots and many other assets to make the documentation more informative, and
        attractive. A stylesheet and images are in the img folder.
    </p>

        This project is a simple Android application built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose and Android's
        Gemini coding agent.
        I have no Kotlin experience; the last Android app I wrote was around 15 years ago, in Java.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first step was to create this project on GitHub. <br/>
        It was then cloned in Android Studio.<br/>
        Android studio was used to create an android app, using the UI Navigation Activity
        template offered during the creation process; the folder selected for the project is this project's folder.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next step was to run the app generated by Android Studio to make sure all is well. It is all well.
    </P>
<h2>Running the default app </h2>
<p>
    The test device (Android phone) is configured to run the app as follows:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>developer options are enabled (using the obscure tap the build number 7 times
        in the about phone settings activity). </li>
        <li>USB debugging is enabled, as a cable is always more reliable
        than wifi or any other wireless communications medium.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    The app is run on the Android test device.<br/>
    The app works.<br/>
</p>
<h2>Files</h2>
<p>
    Once the barebones app runs in Android Studio's emulator and on the test device, it has been
    established that the
    development environment has been correctly configured, and that a project has been created for
    the purpose of writing the app.
    At this point it is worth giving a quick description of the app.
</p>
<p>
    goodViberations is a password manager app. It is a data entry app, the implementation of the app
    uses activities (forms in conventional terms) to perform
    the common CRUD operations on data (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Initially no encryption is defined for the data storage
    and retrieval. During development, it is easier to leave this out. The design uses a separate data
    layer and specification. In this way there is a single place where encryption can be added when everything else
    has been developed and works.

<p>
    Specification files are located in the doc folder.<br/>
    <ul>
        <li>The UI specification is located in <a href="UIActivities.html">UIActivities.html</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>The functionality specification is located in <a href="Functionality.html">Functionality.html</a>.</li>
        <li>The AboutActivity functionality specification is located in
            <a href="functionality/AboutActivityFunctionality.html">AboutActivityFunctionality.html</a>.</li>
        <li>The HelpActivity functionality specification is located in
            <a href="functionality/HelpActivityFunctionality.html">HelpActivityFunctionality.html</a></li>
        <li>The MainActivity functionality specification is located in
            <a href="functionality/MainActivityFunctionality.html">MainActivityFunctionality.html</a> </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>The data layer specification is located in <a href="DataLayer.html">DataLayer.html</a>.</li>
        <li>The data layer unit tests are located in <a href="DataLayerUnitTests.html">DataLayerUnitTests.html</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>A blog, <a href="blogOfThisProject.html">blogOfThisProject.html</a> is also located in the doc folder.
            The blog is used as a kind of diary of the progress of this project. References to git
            tags are given, where
            relevant, so that it is possible to get a snapshot of the project as it was at that
            time.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    The specification files are designed to be readable by humans and Gemini. In doing so, the documentation is also
    used to generate the code by the agent.
