<h1>goodViberations: Functionality Specification</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
<p>
    goodViberations is a password manager app. It is a data entry app, the implementation of the app
    uses activities (forms in conventional terms) to perform
    the common CRUD operations on data (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Initially no encryption is defined for the data storage
    and retrieval. During development, it is easier to leave this out. The design uses a separate data
    layer and specification. In this way there is a single place where encryption can be added when everything else
    has been developed and works.
</p>
<p>
    The data structures used in this app are described in <a href="DataLayer.html">DataLayer.html</a>
</p>
<p>
    In order to successfully encapsulate the functionality required to define the data and to
    implement the CRUD operations on the data, functionality describes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The UI specification, the widgets present in each activity.</li>
    <li>The binding of the data structures to the UI</li>
    <li>The functionality of the app
    <li>the navigation between activities, and the flow of data between activities</li>
</ul>
<p>
    There can be quite a lot of functionality in an activity. For this reason, the documents
    have been organised so that one document describes one activity. All the documents are kept in the
    functionality folder.<br/><br/>
    Initially all the activities do not have a corresponding functionality document. The development
    process is to add one or more functionality specifications, generate the code, review the code,
    test that the generated activity works as expected. Once completed, additional activity specification
    documents can  be added and the process of generation, review, testing can be repeated.
</p>
<h2>Activity design</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>All the activity classes should be in the package com.j3t.dataentryapp.ui.activities</li>
        <li>All the activity classes should be in the folder src/main/java/com/j3t/dataentryapp/ui/activities</li>
        <li>The title is displayed at the top of the activity's  view.</li>
        <li>The activity widgets are placed within a vertically scrolling view. This allows the activity's contents to
            be viewable by the user in portrait and landscape modes.</li>
        <li>Each widget is a class member variable,  this allows for functionality to be added to alter the
            widget's appearance and behaviour at runtime.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    The following functionality specification documents currently exist to describe some of the
    functionality of the app:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="functionality/MainActivityFunctionality.html">MainActivity functionality</a></li>
    <li><a href="functionality/AboutActivityFunctionality.html">AboutActivity functionality</a></li>
    <li><a href="functionality/HelpActivityFunctionality.html">HelpActivity functionality</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
    As the project progresses, new functionality specifications are added. The activities which do not
    yet have a functionality specification are described in <a href="UIActivities.html">UIActivities.html</a>.
</p>
<p>Some terms used in this project are defined below:</p>
<h4>Entry</h4>
<p>
    An entry is defined to be a set of text fields, each field has a name and a value. Some fields
    are unique to an entry type, some are common to all entries. Some field values reflect a data type,
    and so have a syntax associated with them. For example:
    <ul>
        <li>email must have a valid email address syntax,</li>
        <li>url must have a valid http url syntax.</li>
        <li>name by default, starts with an uppercase. It may be set to lowercase by the user of the app.</li>
        <li>name is unique, name is case insensitive for purposes of uniqueness. For example name with
            a value of "name", "Name"
            and "NAME" are all treated as the same in terms of sorting and uniqueness, so only one name field value
            of "name",
            "Name" or "NAME" can be present in the list of entries.</li>
        <li>name is not null, </li>
    </ul>
