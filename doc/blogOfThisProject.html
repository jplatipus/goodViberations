<h1>15 Dec 2025: git tag v2.0</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    This file is going to be maintained as the project progresses. Initially this paragraph is
    the first and last paragraph, as time and new pieces are added, this paragraph will still be the,
    last one, but no longer the first. This is how a blog works, I think.
</p>
<h2>In the beginning (git tags v1.0 and v2.0)</h2>
<p>
    I've created a new android app using Android Studio, and pushed it to git with the
    <strong>tag v1.0</strong>
</p>
<p>
    I am now working on <strong>tag v2.0</strong>, adding the ui specification (<a href="UIActivities.html">UIActivities.html</a>),
    and a start for the functionality specification (<a href="Functionality.html">Functionality.html</a>).
    It is expected that the specs will be updated over the course of this project. Each addition to this blog
    should be accompanied by a git tag, in this way it is possible to get a snapshot of the project that
    matches the blog entry.
