    This page is used to create a new password store file. The file is encrypted, using the password and
    memorable date as keys to encrypt the file.
</p>

    The <strong>password</strong> should be something that is easy to remember by you. Upper case and lower case
    characters are different, so care needs to be taken if text case is present in the password.
    The password should have a minimum of eight characters.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>memorable date</strong> field should be a date that you find easy to remember, a birthday or something
    similar are usually good candidates.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>password</strong> and <strong>memorable</strong> date values are entered twice to help ensure that the values entered
    are those wanted, and that they do not have an error that has not been noticed.
