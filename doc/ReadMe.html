    <h1>ReadMe: goodViberations, built using  AI Agent(s)</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This is a README file for the goodViberations project. It uses html and not markup, txt, or any
        other format. HTML is nice, doesn't need any special software to view the contents either in raw or
        rendered form.
        <br><br/>
        It also allows screenshots and many other assets (stylesheets) to be placed in the img
        folder to make the documentation more informative, and attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project is a simple Android application built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose and Android's
        Gemini coding agent.
        I have no Kotlin experience, last Android app I wrote was around 15 years ago, in Java.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first step was to create this project on GitHub. <br/>
        It was then cloned in Android Studio.<br/>
        Android studio was used to create an android app, using the UI Navigation Activity
        template offered during the creation process, the folder selected for the project is this project's folder.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next step was to run the app generated by Android Studio to make sure all is well. It is all well.
    </P>
    <p>
        I expected AndroidStudio would create
        a subfolder called FirstKotlinApp (the name of this project), but it did not. I asked Gemini to
        move the files to FirstKotlinApp, but it said it could not do that. Android Studio was exited.
    </p>
    <h2>Running the default app </h2>
    <p>
        The test device (Android phone) is configured to run the app as follows:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>developer options are enabled (using the obscure tap the build number 7 times
            in the about phone settings activity). </li>
            <li>USB debugging is enabled, as a cable is always more reliable
            than wifi or any other wireless communications medium.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        The app is run on the Android test device.<br/>
        The app works.<br/>
        Time to commit to git, tag it then push the tag to the remote repository.
