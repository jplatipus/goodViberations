    <h1>ReadMe: goodViberations, built using  AI Agent(s)</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This is a README file for the goodViberations project. It uses html and not markup, txt, or any
        other format. HTML is nice, doesn't need any special software to view the contents either in raw or
        rendered form.
        <br><br/>
        It also allows screenshots and many other assets (stylesheets) to be placed in the img
        folder to make the documentation more informative, and attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project is a simple Android application built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose and Android's
        Gemini coding agent.
        I have no Kotlin experience, last Android app I wrote was around 15 years ago, in Java.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first step was to create this project on GitHub. <br/>
        It was then cloned in Android Studio.<br/>
        Android studio was used to create an android app, using the UI Navigation Activity
        template offered during the creation process, the folder selected for the project is this project's folder.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next step was to run the app generated by Android Studio to make sure all is well. It is all well.
    </P>
<h2>Running the default app </h2>
<p>
    The test device (Android phone) is configured to run the app as follows:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>developer options are enabled (using the obscure tap the build number 7 times
        in the about phone settings activity). </li>
        <li>USB debugging is enabled, as a cable is always more reliable
        than wifi or any other wireless communications medium.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    The app is run on the Android test device.<br/>
    The app works.<br/>
</p>
<h2>Files</h2>
<p>
    Specification files are located in the doc folder.<br/>
    The UI specification is located in <a href="UIActivities.html">UIActivities.html</a>.<br/>
    The functionality specification is located in <a href="Functionality.html">Functionality.html</a>.
    A blog, <a href="blogOfThisProject.html">blogOfThisProject.html</a> is also located in the doc folder.
    The blog is used as a kind of diary of the progress of this project. References to git tags are given, where
    relevant, so that it is possible to get a snapshot of the project as it was at that time.
</p>
<p>
    These files are designed to be readable by humans and Gemini. In doing so, the documentation is also the
    prompts used to generate the code by the agent.
